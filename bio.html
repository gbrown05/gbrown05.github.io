		<p>Hi, I'm George. I was born in Palo Alto, CA, and currently attend <a href="http://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>, where I study computer science and cognitive science. In high school, I was the editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.vikingsportsmag.com">The Viking</a>, a sports magazine. Here at Tufts, I am a writing tutor and I also enjoy playing club baseball around New England. Some of my current interests include cognitive science, human-robot interaction (I work in <a href="http://hrilab.cs.tufts.edu">the HRI lab at Tufts</a>), computer science, computer security, and law. I'm also fond of baseball, backpacking, and rooting for the San Francisco Giants.</p>
