		<p>Hi, I'm George. I was born in Palo Alto, CA, and currently attend <a href="http://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>, where I study computer science and cognitive science. Some of my current interests include cognitive science, human-robot interaction, computer science, computer security, and law. I'm also fond of baseball, backpacking, and rooting for the San Francisco Giants.</p>
