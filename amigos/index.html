  	<h1>Amigos</h1>
      

<h5 id="toc_0">For the past four years, I&rsquo;ve been involved with an organization called <a href="http://amigoslink.org">Amigos de las Am√©ricas</a>.</h5>

<p>This past summer, I worked for Amigos. I have trouble explaining what Amigos is and why it&rsquo;s so important to me, even to my family and friends. This page is my attempt to spread the word about Amigos and explain what it means to me.</p>

<p>It started in 2010, when I trained to be a high school volunteer. I participated
in the Cotopaxi, Ecuador project, living in a community of about 150 people for
seven weeks. My community, San Diego de Mulalillo, is at the top of a mountain
that is nearly 13,000 feet.</p>

<p>You can see several volcanoes from San Diego. I lived with a host family that has three little boys (Miguelito is the boy in the photo above). I also had two partners, one from New Mexico and one from Ohio. The best part of the experience was meeting my host family and the community, and becoming part of the community for the summer.</p>

<h4 id="toc_1">But what does Amigos actually <strong><em>do</em></strong>?</h4>

<p>At its core, Amigos is a youth leadership organization. The vision of Amigos is
&ldquo;a world where each young person becomes a life-long catalyst for social change.&rdquo; Most projects include a <em>microproyecto</em>, where volunteers work with local youth and community members to implement a small community-based initiative. Volunteers also conduct extracurricular activities with younger children, which can be focused on anything that is of interest to the community &ndash; often, themes include the environment and public health.</p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons I believe in Amigos is because it&rsquo;s about developing <strong>all</strong> youth. No matter where you&rsquo;re from, you can participate, learn, and make friendships through Amigos.</p>

<p>Here is a photo of the staff team I worked with this past summer. We had 44 high
school volunteers and over 90 local volunteers. Additionally, we hosted two
weeklong <em>campamentos</em> in three different national parks. About 15
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tico">Tico</a> youth and 15 Amigos volunteers went to each park and participated in trailwork, making new friends throughout the week.</p>
