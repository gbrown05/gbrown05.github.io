Comp 20 Assignment #1 - January 2014
George Brown

Everything described in the assignment has been implemented. Specifically, I created a personal website. In addition to this README, there are six other files:
    * index.html -- home page
    * default.css
    * bio.html
    * bio.css
    * resume.html
    * resume.css


I discussed the assignment with Karan Singhal, Tom Strassner, and Max Cohen. Karan Singhal helped show me the importance of classes in CSS. I also helped Siddhartha Prasad with git.
